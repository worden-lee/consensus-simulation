consensus-simulation
Schematic exploration of consensus process by Lee Worden

Requires adap-dyn library - pull that from 
git@github.com:worden-lee/adap-dyn.git
and satisfy its dependencies as well

Then 'make' followed by './consensus' ought to do it.
It puts its output in 'out/'.

run-batch.pl requires perl modules File::Path, String::ShellQuote,
and Tie::Handle::CSV.
